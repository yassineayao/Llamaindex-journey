# LlamaIndex Daily Learning Journey

Welcome to the LlamaIndex Daily Learning Journey repository! Here, you'll find a log of my daily learning journey with LlamaIndex. Each day, I'll document my progress and insights gained.

## Getting Started

To get started with exploring my daily learning journey, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yassineayao/Llamaindex-journey.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```
   cd Llamaindex-journey
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the script for each day by executing the following command:

```
python main.py -d <num_day>
```

Replace `<num_day>` with the number of the day you want to explore. This will execute the script for the specified day and display the corresponding log of my learning journey.
